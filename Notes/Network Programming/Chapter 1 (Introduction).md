### Client Server Architecture
1. **Client :** Initiates requests to the server to obtain services, data or performed specific action.
2. **Server :** Responsible for handing clients requests and providing the requested service of data.
**Advantages of Client Server Architecture**
- Centralized system with all data in single place.
- Cost efficient requires less maintenance cost and Data recovery is possible.
- The capacity of the client and servers can be changed separately.
**Disadvantages of Client Server Architecture**
- Clients are prone to viruses, Trojans and worms if prevent in the Server or uploaded into the Server.
- Servers are prone to Denial of Service (DOS) attacks.
- Data packets may be spoofed or modified during transmission.
- Phishing or capturing login credentials or other useful information of the user are common and MITM (Man in the Middle) attacks are common.
