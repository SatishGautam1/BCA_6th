### Functions of distributed system
1. Resource sharing
2. Scalability
3. Fault tolerance and reliability
4. Parallel processing
5. Concurrency control
6. Transparency
	- Access Transparency
	- Location Transparency

### Types of distributed system
1. Client server system
2. Peer to peer system
3. Middle-ware 
4. Three-tier
	3-tier system is divided into three parts:
	- The presentation layer/ user interface/ client
	- The application layer/ server/ where data is processed
	- The database layer/ where data is stored or manage
5. N-tier

### Challenges of distributed system
1. Heterogeneity
2. Scalability
3. Fault tolerance
4. Concurrency
5. Latency
6. Security\infty 
7. Consistency
8. Transparency

### Falasis of distributed system
1. Network is reliable
2. Latency is zero
3. Bandwidth is infinite
4. Network is secure
5. Network topology cannot be changed
6. There is one administrator
7. Transport cost is zero
8. Network is homogeneous
