### Concept and types of microeconomics and macroeconomics

#### Microeconomics

Microeconomics is defined as the branch of economic analysis which studies the economic behavior of an individual economic unit may be a person, a particular households, a particular firm and an industry.

According to **K.E. Boulding**, "*Microeconomics is the study of a particular firm, particular households, individual price, wage, the income of the industry and particular commodity.*"

Hence, Microeconomics also explains how an individual allocates his income among various needs as well as how an individual maximize satisfaction level from the consumption of available limited resources.

##### Types of Microeconomics
###### 1. Micro-Statics
It is the economic model which studies different microeconomics variables and their relationships at a given point of time under the condition of equilibrium, other things being equal.

In the given figure, quantity and price are measured on X-Axis and Y-axis respectively. The figure shows DD and SS the demand and supply curves respectively. The equilibrium price of a commodity is established as a point E, where quantities of demand and supplied equals to OQ at price OP.

##### 2. Comparative Micro-Statics
A comparative Micro-Statics compares one equilibrium position with another when data have changed and the system has finally reached another equilibrium position.

It does not show how the system has reached equilibrium position with a change in data. It merely explains and compares the initial equilibrium position with the final one reached after the system has adjusted to a change in data.

In the given figure, quantity and price are measured on X-axis and Y-axis respectively. The initial equilibrium point between DD the demand curve and SS the supply curve is at E.

When demand function shifts upward to D1D1 due to change in some independent variable (such as income), the new equilibrium is at E1, where quantities of demand and supplied equals to OQ1 at the price OP1.

##### 3. Micro-Dynamics
It explains relationship between the macroeconomics variables. It throws full light o what is happening in the market during the period of transition from one static equilibrium point to another.

More specially, it studies the process through which the new equilibrium in the market is established after breaking the initial equilibrium. It explains all types of changes occurred between the two equilibrium.

So, micro-dynamics is the study of the process which shows how the initial equilibrium breaks and attains new equilibrium.

This figure shows how the equilibrium is shifted from E to F. It shows the time path and the change position from E to A, B and C to reach F. It also shows how the variables adjust during the movement between two equilibrium positions.

#### Macroeconomics

Macroeconomics is derived from the Greek word "Makros", which means "big". Hence, macroeconomics studies, not individual units but all the units combined together or the economy as a whole.

Since it studies the economy in aggregate. It studies national income, national output, general price level, total employment, total savings and total investment and so on. It is also called "aggregate economics" or the "income theory".

According to **K.E. Boulding,** *"Macroeconomics deals not with individual quantities but with an aggregate of these quantities of these quantities, not with individuals incomes, but with national income, not with individual prices but price level, not with individual output but with national output"*

Macroeconomics analyzes all aggregate indicators and the microeconomics factors that influence the economy. Government and corporations use macroeconomic models to help in formulating of economic policies and strategies.

#### Types of Macroeconomics
##### 1. Macro-statics Analysis
It explains the total elements of the economy and their relation to the equilibrium state of the whole economy at a particular point at a time. In other words, macro statics economy explains the static equilibrium position of the economy.

The following equation reflects the final position of equilibrium:

**Y = C + I**
**Where,**
**Y = aggregate income
C = aggregate consumption
I = aggregate investment**

The concept of the macro statics can be further explained with the help of the following figure.

In the above diagram, national income is measured along X-axis whereas consumption and investment along Y-axis. The aggregate demand curve (C+I) and aggregate supply curve (45° lines, Y = C+I) of an economy are interested at a point E.

##### 2. Comparative Macro-statics Analysis
Comparative macro statics is concerned with the comparative study of different equilibrium positions attained in an economy resulted by macro variables. It is concerned with the comparison of two or more successive equilibrium positions. But it tells nothing about how the system moves from one position to another.

The comparative macro statics diagram can be illustrated as follows:

![[Pasted image 20240617112927.png]]

In the above diagram, national income is measured along X-axis whereas consumption and investment along Y-axis. E indicates the original equilibrium point where the aggregate demand curve (C+I) and aggregate supply curve (45° lines) are intersected.

So, comparative macro statics is concerned with the comparison with comparison of these two equilibrium points E and E1 that are obtained in an economy.

##### 3. Macro Dynamics
Macro dynamics analysis the process by which the economy moves from one equilibrium point to another as a result of the change in macroeconomic variables. It explains each and every step of change involved in attaining new macroeconomic equilibrium point.

Macro dynamics studies all the changes, changing the path, the equilibrium position of an economy before the change. 

Macro dynamics can be explained further with the help of the following diagram:

![[Pasted image 20240617113917.png]]

In the above diagram, national income is measured along X-axis whereas consumption and investment along Y-axis. The original equilibrium point is E where the level of income is OY.
With the increase in the level of investment i.e. DI, equilibrium point shifts from E to E1 and the level of national income increased from Y to Y1. Thus macro-dynamics studies the process by which the equilibrium point shifts from point E to E1.

### Goals and instruments of macroeconomics
#### Goals
1. **Economic Growth**:
    - **Goal**: Achieve a sustainable rate of economic growth, typically measured by the increase in Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
    - **Importance**: Economic growth leads to higher living standards and increased employment opportunities.
2. **Full Employment**:
    - **Goal**: Attain a high level of employment, where nearly everyone who is willing and able to work can find employment.
    - **Importance**: Reducing unemployment is crucial for economic stability and individual well-being.
3. **Price Stability**:
    - **Goal**: Maintain stable prices, avoiding both excessive inflation and deflation.
    - **Importance**: Price stability ensures that the value of money remains relatively constant, protecting consumers' and businesses' purchasing power.
4. **Balance of Payments Stability**:
    - **Goal**: Achieve a balance between exports and imports to avoid excessive deficits or surpluses in the current account.
    - **Importance**: Stability in the balance of payments helps maintain a stable exchange rate and economic stability.
5. **Equitable Distribution of Income**:
    - **Goal**: Ensure a fair distribution of income across society.
    - **Importance**: Reducing income inequality promotes social stability and ensures that the benefits of economic growth are widely shared.
6. **Sustainable Development**:
    - **Goal**: Promote economic activities that do not deplete natural resources or harm the environment.
    - **Importance**: Ensures that economic growth is environmentally sustainable for future generations.

#### Instruments
1. **Fiscal Policy**:
    - **Tools**: Government spending and taxation.
    - **Use**: Adjusting government expenditure and tax rates to influence aggregate demand. For example, increasing government spending or reducing taxes can stimulate economic activity during a recession.
2. **Monetary Policy**:
    - **Tools**: Control of money supply and interest rates by a central bank.
    - **Use**: Managing the money supply and interest rates to influence inflation and economic growth. Lowering interest rates can encourage borrowing and investment, while raising rates can help control inflation.
3. **Exchange Rate Policy**:
    - **Tools**: Intervention in the foreign exchange market, adjustment of exchange rates.
    - **Use**: Managing the currency value to influence trade balances. A weaker currency can make exports more competitive, while a stronger currency can reduce inflationary pressures from imports.
4.  **Supply-Side Policies**:
    - **Tools**: Regulatory reform, tax incentives, education and training programs.
    - **Use**: Improving the efficiency and productivity of the economy by enhancing the supply of goods and services. For example, reducing regulation can lower costs for businesses and encourage investment.
5.  **Income Policies**:
    - **Tools**: Wage and price controls, guidelines for wage and price increases.
    - **Use**: Directly managing wages and prices to control inflation. This is less common today but was used in the past to combat hyperinflation.
6.  **Trade Policy**:
    - **Tools**: Tariffs, quotas, trade agreements.
    - **Use**: Regulating international trade to protect domestic industries, promote exports, or achieve trade balance objectives.
