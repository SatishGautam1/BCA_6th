Theory of Consumer Behavior typically covers aspects related to how consumers make choices regarding the goods and services they purchase.
### Concept of cardinal and ordinal utility analysis
#### Concept of Utility
Utility refers to the satisfaction or pleasure that a consumer derives from consuming goods and services. Understanding utility is essential for analyzing consumer behavior, which involves how consumers make decisions to allocate their limited resources to maximize their satisfaction.
#### 1. Cardinal Utility Analysis
Cardinal utility suggests that the satisfaction derived from consumption can be measured in quantitative terms. This approach assumes that utility can be expressed in actual numerical values, such as "utils".
##### Key Assumptions
1. **Measurability:** Utility can be measured and assigned specific values.
2. **Additivity:** Total utility is the sum of the utilities from individual units of goods.
3. **Marginal Utility:** The additional utility gained from consuming an extra unit of a good.
##### Important Concepts
- **Total Utility(TU):** The overall satisfaction obtained from consuming a given quantity of goods.
- **Marginal Utility(MU):** The additional satisfaction from consuming one more unit of a good. Mathematically, $$ MU = \frac{ΔTU}{ΔQ} $$
#### 2. Ordinal Utility Analysis
Ordinal utility theory focuses on the ranking or ordering of preferences rather than qualifying utility in numerical terms. It emphasizes that consumers can rank different combinations of goods based on their preferences but does not assign specific values to utility levels.
##### Key Concepts
- **Preference Ranking:** Consumers can express their preferences by ranking bundles of goods from most preferred to least preferred.
- **Indifference Curves:** Graphical representations showing combinations of goods that provide the same level of satisfaction to the consumer.
- **Consumer Equilibrium:** Achieved when the consumer selects a combination of goods where the highest possible indifference curve is tangent to the budget constraint line, indicating the maximum satisfaction given income and prices.
#### Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility
This law states that as a consumer consumes more units of a good, the marginal utility of each additional unit decreases. This is a fundamental concept in consumer behavior and helps explain why consumers typically seek to balance their consumption across different goods to maximize overall satisfaction.

Example:
- Consuming the first slice of pizza may provide high satisfaction.
- The second slice provides less additional satisfaction.
- By the fifth slice, the additional satisfaction might be very low or even negative.

### Cardinal utility analysis
Cardinal utility analysis is a method in economics that qualifies the quantifies the satisfaction or utility that a consumer derives from consuming goods and services. This concept is based on the idea that utility can be measured and expressed in cardinal numbers like 1, 2, 3 etc.
#### Assumptions of cardinal utility
1. **Measurability:** Utility can be measured in quantitative terms(utils).
2. **Additivity:** Total utility is the sum of utilities derived from each unit of consumption.
3. **Rationality:** Consumers are rational and aim to maximize their utility.
4. **Marginal Utility of Money:** Marginal utility of money remains constant.
5. **Diminishing Marginal Utility:** As more units of goods are consumed, the additional satisfaction gained from consuming each additional unit decreases. 
6. **Independent Utilities:** The utility derived from one good is independent of the utility derived from other goods.
#### Consumer's equilibrium
Consumer's equilibrium is a state where a consumer maximize their utility given their budget constraints. This occurs when the following conditions are met:
1. **Marginal Utility per Price Spent:** The marginal utility per price spent on each good is equal for all goods. Mathematically, this is represented as:
$$ \frac{MU_{A}}{P_{A}} = \frac{MU_{B}}{P_{B}} = ... = \frac{MU_{n}}{P_{n}}$$
	where MU is the marginal utility of good and P is the price of the good.

2. **Budget Constraint:** The total expenditure on all goods equals the consumer's income.
$$ P_{A}.Q_{A}+P_{B}.Q_{B}+...+P_{n}.Q_{n}=M $$
	where Q is the quantity of the good and M is the total income.
#### Criticisms of cardinal utility
1. **Measurement Issue:** Utility is subjective and cannot be measured precisely in quantitative terms.
2. **Constancy of Marginal Utility of Money:** The assumption that the marginal utility of money remains constant is unrealistic.
3. **Interdependence of Utilities:** The assumption that utilities are independent is often violated, as consumption of one good can affect the utility of another.
4. **Rationality Assumption:** Consumers do not always act rationality; emotional and psychological factors often influence decisions.
5. **Complexity and Simplification:** The cardinal utility approach oversimplifies consumer behavior by reducing it to mathematical terms.
#### Derivation of demand curve
The demand curve the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded, holding other factors constant. The derivation of the demand curve using cardinal utility involves the following steps:
1. **Marginal Utility and Demand:** As the price of good decreases, the quantity demanded increase due to the law of diminishing marginal utility. Consumers allocate their income to maximize utility, , purchasing more of the good as it becomes cheaper.
2. **Consumer Equilibrium and Price Changes:** When the price of a good changes, the consumer reallocates their budget to reach a new equilibrium where the marginal utility per dollar spent is equalized across all goods.
3. **Price-Quantity Relationship:** By plotting the various quantities demanded at different prices, the downward-sloping demand curve is derived. This reflects the inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded, consistent with the law of demand.

In summary, cardinal utility analysis provides a framework for understanding consumer behavior, though it is often criticized for its unrealistic assumptions. The derivation of the demand curve from cardinal utility emphasizes the impact of price changes on consumer equilibrium and quantity demanded.
