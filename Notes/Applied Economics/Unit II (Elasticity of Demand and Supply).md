### Price Elasticity
1. Price same quantity change, $Ep=infinite$
2. Price change quantity same, $Ep=0$
3. Price is decreased by little but quantity is increased by more, $Ep>1$
4. Price is decreased by more but quantity is increased by less, $Ep<1$
5. Change in price and quantity is same, $Ep=1$

### Measuring Price Elasticity of Demand
1. Total Outlay Method
2. The Point Method
3. The Arc Method
4. The Percentage Method

### Types of Income Elasticity Demand
1. Positive income elasticity of demand, $Ey>0$
	- Income elasticity greater than unity, $Ey>1$
	- Income elasticity equal to unity, $Ey=1$
	- Income elasticity less than unity, $Ey<1$
2. Negative income elasticity of demand, $Ey<0$
3. Zero income elasticity of demand, $Ey=0$
