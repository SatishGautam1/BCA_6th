### Concept and types of price, income and cross elasticity of demand
Elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded of a good responds to changes in various economic variables. There are three main types of elasticity of demand: price elasticity, income elasticity, and cross elasticity. Let's explore each of these concepts in detail.

#### 1. Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)
Price elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of a good to a change in its price. It is calculated as:
 $$ PED = \frac{\%\ change\ in\ quantity\ demanded}{\%\ change\ in\ price} $$
#### Types of Price Elasticity of Demand:
- **Elastic Demand (PED > 1):** Quantity demanded changes by a larger percentage than the price change.
- **Inelastic Demand (PED < 1):** Quantity demanded changes by a smaller percentage than the price change.
- **Unitary Elastic Demand (PED = 1):** Quantity demanded changes by the same percentage as the price change.
- **Perfectly Elastic Demand (PED = ∞):** Quantity demanded changes infinitely with any small change in price.
- **Perfectly Inelastic Demand (PED = 0):** Quantity demanded remains unchanged regardless of the price change.

#### 2. Income Elasticity of Demand (IED)
Income elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of a good to a change in consumer income. It is calculated as:
 $$ YED = \frac{\%\ change\ in\ quantity\ demand}{\%\ change\ in\ income} $$
#### Types of Income Elasticity of Demand:
- **Positive Income Elasticity (YED > 0):** Quantity demanded increases as income increases (normal goods).
    - **Luxury Goods (YED > 1):** Demand increases more than proportionally with income.
    - **Necessities (0 < YED < 1):** Demand increases less than proportionally with income.
- **Negative Income Elasticity (YED < 0):** Quantity demanded decreases as income increases (inferior goods).

#### 3. Cross Elasticity of Demand (XED)
Cross elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of one good to a change in the price of another good. It is calculated as:
 $$ XED = \frac{\%\ change\ in\ quantity\ demanded\ of\ Good\ A}{\%\ change\ in\ price\ of\ Good\ B} $$
#### Types of Cross Elasticity of Demand:
- **Positive Cross Elasticity (XED > 0):** Quantity demanded of Good A increases as the price of Good B increases (substitute goods).
- **Negative Cross Elasticity (XED < 0):** Quantity demanded of Good A decreases as the price of Good B increases (complementary goods).
- **Zero Cross Elasticity (XED = 0):** Quantity demanded of Good A is unaffected by the price change of Good B (unrelated goods).

### Importance and Applications
Understanding these elasticities helps businesses and policymakers make informed decisions about pricing, production, and taxation. For instance:
- **Businesses:** Use price elasticity to set pricing strategies that maximize revenue.
- **Government:** Uses income elasticity to predict tax revenue changes with economic growth.
- **Marketing:** Uses cross elasticity to identify potential substitutes and complements for better positioning of products in the market.
By analyzing how demand responds to changes in price, income, and the prices of related goods, stakeholders can develop strategies to optimize performance and anticipate market dynamics.

### Measurement of price, income and cross elasticity of demand: Total outlay method and Point method

#### 1. Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)

**Total Outlay (Total Revenue) Method:** The total outlay method evaluates elasticity based on the relationship between total revenue (price multiplied by quantity) and price changes.
- **Elastic Demand (PED > 1):** Total revenue moves in the opposite direction of price changes. If the price decreases, total revenue increases, and vice versa.
- **Inelastic Demand (PED < 1):** Total revenue moves in the same direction as price changes. If the price decreases, total revenue decreases, and vice versa.
- **Unitary Elastic Demand (PED = 1):** Total revenue remains unchanged when the price changes.

**Point Method:** The point method calculates elasticity at a specific point on the demand curve. It is determined using the formula:
 $$ PED = \frac{ΔQ}{ΔP}×\frac{P}{Q} $$
Where:
- ΔQ is the change in quantity demanded.
- ΔP is the change in price.
- P is the initial price.
- Q is the initial quantity demanded.

#### 2. Income Elasticity of Demand (YED)

**Total Outlay Method:** This method is not commonly used for measuring income elasticity of demand.

**Point Method:** Income elasticity at a specific point is calculated similarly to the price elasticity but focuses on changes in income:
 $$ YED = \frac{ΔQ}{ΔI}×\frac{I}{Q} $$
Where:
- ΔQ is the change in quantity demanded.
- ΔI is the change in income.
- I is the initial income.
- Q is the initial quantity demanded.

#### 3. Cross Elasticity of Demand (XED)

**Total Outlay Method:** This method is not typically used for cross elasticity of demand.

**Point Method:** Cross elasticity at a specific point is calculated as follows:
 $$ XED = \frac{ΔQ_{A}}{ΔP_{B}}×\frac{P_{B}}{Q_{A}} $$
Where:
- ΔQA​ is the change in quantity demanded of Good A.
- ΔPB​ is the change in price of Good B.
- PB​ is the initial price of Good B.
- QA​ is the initial quantity demanded of Good A.

#### Summary of Methods

**Total Outlay Method:**
- Focuses on the relationship between total revenue and price changes.
- Useful primarily for price elasticity of demand.

**Point Method:**
- Provides precise elasticity at a specific point on the demand curve.
- Applicable to price, income, and cross elasticity of demand.
- Relies on changes in quantity, price, and income (or price of another good) to measure responsiveness.

### Uses of price, income and cross elasticity

#### 1. Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)

1. **Pricing Strategy:**
	- **Firms:** Businesses use PED to set optimal prices for maximizing revenue. For goods with elastic demand, firms may lower prices to increase total revenue. For inelastic goods, firms might raise prices to boost revenue without significantly reducing sales.
2. **Taxation Policy:**
	- **Government:** Understanding PED helps governments predict the impact of taxes on consumption. For inelastic goods (e.g., tobacco, fuel), higher taxes can raise substantial revenue without drastically reducing demand.
3. **Production Planning:**
	- **Firms:** Companies use PED to decide on production levels. If demand is elastic, firms might produce more during price cuts to meet increased demand, whereas for inelastic goods, production may remain stable despite price changes.
4. **Marketing and Advertising:**
	- **Firms:** Businesses with products having elastic demand may invest more in advertising and promotions to boost sales since small price changes can significantly affect demand.
5. **Price Discrimination:**
	- **Firms:** PED helps in segmenting markets for price discrimination. Firms charge different prices in different markets based on elasticity (e.g., airlines charging different fares for business and economy travelers).
	
#### 2. Income Elasticity of Demand (YED)

1. **Forecasting Sales:**
	- **Firms:** Businesses use YED to predict changes in demand based on economic conditions. For normal goods, demand increases with rising incomes, while for inferior goods, demand may decrease as incomes grow.
2. **Product Development:**
	- **Firms:** Understanding YED helps firms develop products targeting different income groups. Luxury goods are aimed at high-income consumers, while necessity and inferior goods cater to middle and low-income groups.
3. **Economic Policy:**
	- **Government:** Policymakers use YED to anticipate how changes in national income affect overall consumption patterns, helping in designing policies to stimulate economic growth.
4. **Investment Decisions:**
	- **Investors:** Investors consider YED to identify sectors that will grow with increasing national income, such as luxury goods and services, and those that might shrink, like inferior goods.
	
#### 3. Cross Elasticity of Demand (XED)

1. **Competitive Strategy:**
	- **Firms:** Companies analyze XED to understand the impact of competitors' pricing on their own products. High positive XED indicates strong substitutes, prompting firms to monitor competitors’ prices closely.
2. **Complementary Products:**
	- **Firms:** Businesses use XED to identify complementary products. Negative XED indicates that products are complements, guiding firms in bundling and cross-promoting products.
3. **Merger and Acquisition Decisions:**
	- **Firms:** High cross elasticity between products can be a factor in deciding mergers or acquisitions, as combining businesses with high substitute goods can enhance market control.
4. **Product Positioning:**
	- **Firms:** Understanding XED helps in positioning products against competitors and identifying potential gaps in the market for new product development.
	
#### Practical Examples

- **Pricing Strategy:** A company producing luxury cars with elastic demand might lower prices during an economic downturn to maintain sales volume.
- **Taxation Policy:** Governments might impose higher taxes on inelastic goods like cigarettes, knowing demand will remain relatively stable.
- **Production Planning:** A beverage company may increase production during a price promotion to meet the higher demand due to elastic demand for soft drinks.
- **Marketing and Advertising:** An electronics manufacturer might increase advertising for a new smartphone model, leveraging the elastic demand to boost sales.
- **Price Discrimination:** An airline uses PED to charge higher prices for last-minute bookings (inelastic demand) and lower prices for early bird offers (elastic demand).
- **Forecasting Sales:** A grocery chain uses YED to stock more luxury food items in high-income areas, anticipating higher demand as incomes rise.
- **Product Development:** A car manufacturer introduces a line of economy cars targeting lower-income consumers, recognizing the inferior good's demand characteristic.
- **Competitive Strategy:** A smartphone company monitors competitors’ price changes to adjust its pricing strategy, knowing high XED indicates strong substitution effects.
- **Complementary Products:** A gaming console manufacturer collaborates with game developers, recognizing that consoles and games have high negative XED.
- **Merger and Acquisition Decisions:** A dairy company considers acquiring a plant-based milk producer due to high cross elasticity, aiming to diversify its product portfolio and capture market share from substitutes.

### Concept of elasticity of supply and its measurement

**Elasticity of supply** measures how much the quantity supplied of a good changes in response to a change in the price of that good. It is a crucial concept in economics as it helps understand the responsiveness of producers to price changes, which can influence market dynamics and pricing strategies.

**Formula:**
  $$ E_{s} = \frac{\%\ change\ in\ quantity\ supplied}{\%\ change\ in\ price} $$
  Where:
- Es​ is the elasticity of supply.
- % change in quantity supplied is the percentage change in the quantity of goods supplied.
- % change in price is the percentage change in the price of the goods.

#### Types of Supply Elasticity

1. **Perfectly Elastic Supply (Es = ∞)**
	- Quantity supplied changes infinitely with any small change in price.
	- The supply curve is horizontal.

2. **Perfectly Inelastic Supply (Es = 0)**
	- Quantity supplied remains constant regardless of price changes.
	- The supply curve is vertical.
		![[Pasted image 20240618162556.png]]
3. **Unitary Elastic Supply (Es > 1)**
	- Percentage change in quantity supplied is equal to the percentage change in price.
	- The supply curve is a straight line passing through the origin.
		![[Pasted image 20240618164454.png]]
4. **Elastic Supply (Es >1)**
	- Quantity supplied changes by a greater percentage than the price change.
	- The supply curve is relatively flat.
		![[Pasted image 20240618165254.png]]
5. **Inelastic Supply (Es < 1)**
	- Quantity supplied changes by a smaller percentage than the price change.
	- The supply curve is relatively steep.

#### Measurement of Elasticity of Supply

1. **Percentage Method**
	- Calculates the elasticity by dividing the percentage change in quantity supplied by the percentage change in price.
	- Example:
		- If the price of a good increases by 10% and the quantity supplied increases by 15%, the elasticity of supply is 15%/10% = 1.5
		
2.  **Point Method**
	- Measures elasticity at a specific point on the supply curve.
	- Formula:  $$ E_{s} = \frac{ΔQ_{S}}{ΔP}×\frac{P}{Q_{S}} $$
	- Where ΔQs​ is the change in quantity supplied, ΔP is the change in price, P is the original price, and Qs​ is the original quantity supplied.
	
1. **Arc Method**
	- Measures elasticity over a range of the supply curve, useful when there are large changes in price and quantity.
	- Formula: $$ E_{S}\ = \frac{ΔQ_{s}}{ΔP}×\frac{(P_{1}+P_{2})/2}{(Q_{s1}+Q_{s2})/2} $$
	- Where P1​ and P2​ are the initial and final prices, and Qs1 and Qs2​ are the initial and final quantities supplied.

#### Factors Affecting Elasticity of Supply

1. **Availability of Inputs**:
    - Easier access to raw materials and other inputs increases elasticity.
2. **Time Period**:
    - Supply tends to be more elastic in the long run as producers have more time to adjust production.
3. **Spare Capacity**:
    - Firms with spare production capacity can increase output more easily, leading to higher elasticity.
4. **Flexibility of Production Process**:
    - More flexible production processes enhance the ability to change the quantity supplied in response to price changes.
5. **Storage Ability**:
    - Goods that can be stored easily without deterioration have higher elasticity as suppliers can manage inventory better in response to price changes.
